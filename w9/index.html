	<h2>Step 1: Reflection</h2>
	<p>I was inspired by websites with clean design and simple hirarchy and flow. Some of the websites which really inspired me were Refinery29 and Garance Dore</p>
	<p>I really like how my header and nav turned out. The nav could use more work with responsive design. I really enjoyed playing around with the layout and colour schemes. I had a few issues with the column layout and positioning - alignment issues were my main hurdle. it was also important for me to understand what content was going on the page so that I could come up with a design that would best suit that content.</p>
	<p>Understanding Responsive Design takes a few trial and error attempts. Understanding how to space columns and align images was a bit of a challenge for me.</p>
	<h2>Step 2: Reviews</h2>
	<h4>Business of Fashion</h4>
	<p>I really like this website because of its clear layout and flow. The large centred header and nav focus your eye to the center of the page which then leads your eye down to the large main images and then onto the side advertising panel to the right. The monochrome colour scheme allows the images and content to really stand out. The nav being the only typography on the page allows it to stand out at the top of the page as you scroll down through the other articles on the site.</p>
	<h4>CAVS.MIT.EDU</h4>
	<p>This page is very busy, lacks flow and balance. The gifs are very annoying and distracting. My eye is initially drawn to the logo - Center for Advanced Visual Studies but the moving greyscale and the surrounding images and gifs are very distracting and confusing. They are weaved in with text and images and do not point to any clear themes or information about the site/company/project. Also, i am unsure where the actual navigation can be found on the page.</p>
